            <p class="mb-3">
                This privacy statement explains how the CEM Projects Portal (the &quot;Portal&quot;) processes and protects personal data.
                The Portal is managed by the Computational and Experimental Mechanics (CEM) Division within the Department of Mechanical Engineering
                of Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e).
            </p>
            <p>
                The Portal supports students enrolled in an academic program in selecting a thesis/graduation project.
                The Portal is designed to process as little personal data as possible. We do not create user profiles and we do not use tracking
                or analytics to analyse or profile visitor behaviour.

            <p class="mb-3">
                The Portal uses SURFconext for authentication via Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). SURFconext enables secure single sign-on (SSO)
                for education and research institutions in the Netherlands.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
                When you sign in to the Portal:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-2 ml-4">
                <li>You are redirected to SURFconext for authentication.</li>
                <li>SURFconext verifies your identity via your home institution (e.g. TU/e).</li>
                <li>After successful authentication, SURFconext provides the Portal with a SAML assertion containing the minimum necessary attributes.</li>
                <li>
                    We only process the minimum required data for affiliation verification and access control, such as:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li>A persistent identifier (pseudonym) to link your session.</li>
                        <li>Institutional affiliation (e.g. student/staff) to grant access.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We do not store your password. Authentication is handled by SURFconext and your home institution.

            <p class="mb-3">
                As a general principle, the Portal does not process personal data in the sense of creating user profiles or storing identifying information on a long-term basis.
                However, during the authentication process we temporarily process a limited set of personal data provided via SURFconext
                (such as a persistent identifier and affiliation) in order to verify whether you are allowed to access the Portal.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
                This authentication data is used solely for granting access and security. It is not used for tracking, profiling, or analysing individual usage.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Information entered via filters or search functionality (such as project type, tags, sections, or other search criteria) is not stored on a long-term basis
                as personal data and is not linked to your identity or used for tracking/profiling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Technical logs (such as web server logs and error logs) may temporarily contain IP addresses and technical metadata for security, abuse prevention,
                and troubleshooting purposes. This data is not used for tracking or profiling.

            <p class="mb-3">
                We do not share personal data for commercial purposes and we do not provide personal data to third parties for tracking, marketing, or profiling.

                For authentication, we use SURFconext. Necessary attributes are transferred from your home institution via SURFconext to the Portal

            <p class="mb-3">
                Within TU/e, functional and technical administrators may have access to administrative functionality and (where required) technical data
                for management, support, security, and troubleshooting purposes. Such access is limited to what is necessary to perform their tasks
                and is subject to internal authorisations and access controls.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-heading text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-2 text-lg sm:text-xl">6.2 Service providers (processors)</h3>
            <p class="mb-3">
                We may use external service providers (e.g. hosting providers) for technical infrastructure. If such parties process personal data on behalf of TU/e,
                appropriate arrangements are made in line with TU/e policy (such as a data processing agreement) and appropriate security measures.
            </p>

            <p>
                We do not sell, rent, or commercialise personal data.

            <p class="mb-3">
                Authentication attributes processed via SURFconext are used only during sign-in and the active session and are not stored on a long-term basis
                in a user database or profile.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Technical logs (such as web server logs and error logs) may be retained temporarily for security and troubleshooting. These logs are retained for a limited time
                and deleted periodically in accordance with applicable TU/e retention policies and operational necessity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the Portal does not maintain user profiles, in practice there is typically no long-term stored personal data within the Portal to delete upon request.

            <p class="mb-3">
                Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you may have (depending on the circumstances) the following rights:

            </ul>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Because the Portal does not create user profiles and does not store personal data on a long-term basis, some rights may have limited practical applicability
                within the Portal itself. If your request concerns authentication data held by your home institution or SURFconext, it may be necessary to handle your request
                (partly) via those parties.
