                The Computational and Experimental Mechanics (CEM) Division is one of three core divisions within the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology. Our division encompasses three research sections that drive innovation in materials science, manufacturing, and microsystems technology.

            <p class="mb-4">
                Through the <strong>Mechanics of Materials (MoM)</strong> section, we explore advanced material behavior and design. The <strong>Processing and Performance (PP)</strong> section focuses on manufacturing processes and material performance optimization. Our <strong>Microsystems (MS)</strong> section pioneers research in microscale systems and technologies.
